tjtag-pi is a fork of [tjtag][] with support for [Raspberry Pi][pi]
which eliminates the need for a PC with parallel port.

For Pi3, compile it with:
        $ make pi3

For Pi4, compile it with:
        $ make pi4

WARNING
=======

Be warned that incorrect usage can lead to a point of no return
situation. Before you do anything besides what is described here, please
do research on how to use this tool. A good starting point is the
excellent and cautionary `guide.pdf` written by the HairyDairyMaid, the
original author. Always backup before flashing.

Requirements
============

 * A Raspberry Pi (I've only tested model B as of late 2013)
 * [Dual female jumper wires][jumper] to connect GPIO pins to WRT
 * Pins soldered on the JTAG header on WRT
 * Beverege to enjoy afterward

Setup
=====

 1. Hook up the two boards as per the diagram in `wiring.jpg`
 2. Power up your WRT
 3. Checkout the code, compile and run it

        $ cd ~
        $ git clone git@github.com:oxplot/tjtag-pi.git
        $ cd tjtag-pi
        $ make pi
        $ ./tjtag -probeonly

    If it gets stuck, try using `/noemw` option.

If at this point, your SoC and flash is recognized, you're all set.
Enjoy your beverage and look for an appropriate guide that explains how
to use tjtag to revive/upgrade your router's firmware.

Notes
=====

 * If you have issues with reliability of your connection, you can slow
   down the speed of _tjtag_ by using `/delay:N` command line option.
   `N` is the amount of time to delay flipping the clock signal. The
   higher the value, the slower the transfer rate.
 * Due to bit-banging nature of the operation of tjtag, various things
   affect the transfer speed. The one with most degrading effect is the
   progress output. Therefore it is recommended to use `/silent` command
   line option and redirect outputs to `/dev/null` (ie using
   `&> /dev/null`), after having made sure everything works OK.
